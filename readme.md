====


`noide` is a web-based code editor built using Node.js.

It's a useful, lightweight editor that runs in the browser.

Instructions
============

`npm install noide -g`

Then cd to the directory you want to edit and execute

`noide`

Now point your browser to http://localhost:3000/

You should see a page something like this:

![ide](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidjamesstone/noide/master/screenshot.png "IDE")


*** WARNING ***
================
If you'd like to try out this IDE that's great BUT USE CAUTION.

Ensure any code is backed up regularly.
I would not like it to be responsible for any work lost.

Also, there is no authentication or security built in. That is left to you. Do not run on a publicly accessible server/port.
